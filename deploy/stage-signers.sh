# Stages separate signer services on this host from the live signer set, as
# a rehearsal for Phase 2: one directory per key, a keyless coordinator, and
# a service file for each signer. It starts nothing and doesn't touch the
# running bridge. docs/SIGNERS.md ("Moving an existing deployment") and
# docs/FIRST-ROUND-TRIP.md cover the switch itself.
#
# Keys go from the live set to each signer through a pipe: never on a command
# line, in the environment or on screen. The script checks the staged set has
# the same keys in the same order, so the peg address can't change.

# Settings, from the environment:
#   SOURCE      the live signer set (with private keys)
#   STAGE       where to stage; must not exist yet. The default is inside the
#               secrets folder, so the daily backup includes it
#   BTCVM      the btcvm binary
#   BRIDGE_ENV  node settings to give each signer
#   REGISTRY    the bridge's deposit address registry, copied to each signer
#   RUN_AS      the user the signers run as; empty for the current user
#   MAX_DAILY   most BTC each signer approves moving in 24 hours
#   NETWORK     Bitcoin and BTCVM network
#   POLICY      the bridge's policy flags; must match its service
